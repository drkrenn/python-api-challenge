# python-api-challenge

The code for this assignment is found in two separate folders. The code for weather and vacation are found in the WeatherPY and VacationPY folders. 

There were two places that required some help from learning assistants. 
First, I worked with learning assistant to get the data call from the API entered correctly. I was a little lost at first, and had a lot of guidance to get started. 
Second, I needed help debugging step 4 in the second activity. Everything was correct except for 1-2 lines, and I could not find the mistake. 

Aside from these two spots, all code was self generated or modified from class activity code.
